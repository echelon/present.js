Generates an HTML slideshow presentation from Markdown-formatted files.
_(A work in progress.)_

Simple slideshows can easily be created and manipulated in a text editor.
As long as a suitable browser is available, there should be no need for a 
GUI or for proprietary software. 

* **presentation.html** runs the slideshow. The url GET parameter 'mkd'
  sets the source filename. The browser should default to looking in the
  current directory. (Firefox does.)

* **presentation-s5.html** runs the slideshow in 
  [S5 Reloaded 1.3](http://www.netzgesta.de/S5/) instead of my software. 
  The code to load/interpret Markdown documents is called, but the output
  format is different. This may be good backup. 

This repository also contains the following:

* [Showdown](http://attacklab.net/showdown/) for markdown. 
* jQuery and several plugins. 

The S5 slideshow system is also included as a backup.
